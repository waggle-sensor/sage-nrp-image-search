# Benchmark Dockerfile Template
# Copy this file to your benchmark directory and customize as needed.
# 
# Usage:
#   1. Copy this file to your benchmark directory as Dockerfile.benchmark or Dockerfile.data_loader
#   2. Update the CMD line with your entrypoint script (e.g., "main.py" or "load_data.py")
#   3. Ensure requirements.txt includes imsearch-eval package
#
# Example for Dockerfile.benchmark:
#   CMD ["python", "main.py"]
#
# Example for Dockerfile.data_loader:
#   CMD ["python", "load_data.py"]

# Copy requirements
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Note: The imsearch-eval package is installed via requirements.txt
# No need to set PYTHONPATH as the package is installed in the Python environment

# Set your entrypoint script here
# For evaluator: CMD ["python", "main.py"]
# For data loader: CMD ["python", "load_data.py"]
CMD ["python", "main.py"]
